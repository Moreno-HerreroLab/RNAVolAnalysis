# RNAVolAnalysis
This MATLAB GUI is designed to streamline the image analysis of AFM imaging, focusing on extracting the volumes of specific areas in single-stranded nucleic acids. Specially developed for exacting 'volume profiles' along single-stranded RNA molecules. 

## Features

- **Image Loading and Preprocessing:** Easily load AFM images into the GUI and apply essential preprocessing steps such as gaussian blurring.

- **Segmentation and Identification:** Utilize advanced image segmentation techniques to isolate RNA molecules within AFM images. The GUI provides auto-threshoolding or manual for accurately identify regions of interest.

- **Volume Calculation:** Calculate the volume of RNA molecules based on the segmented images. The GUI provides visualization tools to aid in result validation.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with both beginners and experienced researchers in mind, the GUI offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface. It enables efficient analysis even for those without extensive programming experience.

- **Data Export and Reporting:** Generate comprehensive reports containing and calculated volumes, thresholds used and background noise. Export results in .txt formats for further analysis.
